## Customer Communication – MFA Issue Recovery

**Subject:** AWS Account Access – MFA Recovery Process Initiated

Hello [Customer Name],

We understand you are unable to access your AWS account due to an MFA device tied to a former employee. We take account security very seriously, and our goal is to help you regain secure access.

Here is what we will do:
1. Verify if any existing IAM users/roles can reset MFA.
2. If not possible, we will initiate internal ownership verification.
3. Once completed, MFA will be reset, and a new secure device can be assigned.

Best Practices after recovery:
- Assign MFA to corporate-owned devices.
- Create at least 2 IAM admin users to avoid single points of failure.
- Document and enforce an offboarding process for IT staff.

Thank you for your cooperation,
